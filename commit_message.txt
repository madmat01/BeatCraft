Add dual playback system for synchronized audio and drum sequencer

This commit adds the following features:
1. New DualPlayback component that synchronizes original audio with the drum sequencer
2. Integration with Tone.js transport for sample-accurate synchronization
3. Volume control for the original audio file
4. Updated useDrumSequencer hook with external transport access
5. Comprehensive test coverage for the new functionality
6. Updated todo.md to reflect completed and new tasks

This implementation allows users to hear their original audio alongside the generated drum pattern, providing a more complete music production experience.
