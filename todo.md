# Step-by-Step To-Do List for Building BeatCraft App

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning

- [ ] Define project repository structure (frontend, backend, shared assets)  
- [ ] Setup version control (Git) and remote repo (GitHub/GitLab)  
- [ ] Choose Python web framework (Flask or FastAPI) and initialize backend project  
- [ ] Initialize frontend project with React and package manager (npm/yarn)  
- [ ] Setup basic Docker containers for backend and frontend development environments  

---

## Phase 2: Backend Core Development

### 2.1 Audio Analysis Module

- [ ] Implement audio file upload endpoint  
- [ ] Integrate `librosa` to load audio and extract onset envelope  
- [ ] Develop tempo detection using `librosa.beat.beat_track()`  
- [ ] Implement swing ratio estimation via IOI histogram and Gaussian fitting  
- [ ] Write unit tests for tempo and swing extraction functions  

### 2.2 MIDI Generation Module

- [ ] Define drum instrument-to-MIDI note mapping  
- [ ] Create function to generate initial drum pattern based on tempo and swing  
- [ ] Integrate `pretty_midi` to build and export MIDI files  
- [ ] Develop API endpoint to return generated MIDI pattern data and downloadable MIDI file  

---

## Phase 3: Frontend Core Development

### 3.1 UI Framework & Basic Layout

- [ ] Setup React project structure with components folder  
- [ ] Implement file upload component and connect to backend API  
- [ ] Design and build main layout: top panel, sidebar, sequencer grid, control panel  

### 3.2 Audio Playback & Swing Control

- [ ] Integrate Tone.js for sample playback and transport control  
- [ ] Build Swing/Shuffle slider component linked to Tone.Transport.swing  
- [ ] Implement step sequencer grid with per-instrument rows and time columns  
- [ ] Add velocity and probability controls per drum component  

### 3.3 Sample Library & Assignment

- [ ] Create sample browser UI with categorized default kits  
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop sample assignment to drum pads  
- [ ] Add sample preview on hover and playback on selection  

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Features & Polishing

### 4.1 Metronome & Recording

- [ ] Build metronome component with visual and audio feedback  
- [ ] Implement tap-tempo and count-in features  
- [ ] Develop recording interface to capture user input along metronome  
- [ ] Integrate backend processing for transient detection on recorded input  

### 4.2 Editing & Humanization

- [ ] Enable per-note microtiming offset adjustments  
- [ ] Add mute/solo toggles for drum components  
- [ ] Implement velocity curves and randomization options  
- [ ] Provide undo/redo functionality in sequencer editor  

### 4.3 Export & Integration

- [ ] Add MIDI export button with backend MIDI file generation  
- [ ] Test exported MIDI files in popular DAWs (Logic Pro, Ableton Live)  
- [ ] Optimize API responses and frontend loading for smooth UX  

---

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment

- [ ] Write end-to-end tests covering upload, analysis, editing, playback, and export  
- [ ] Conduct user testing sessions for UI/UX feedback  
- [ ] Optimize audio processing performance (Web Workers, caching)  
- [ ] Setup CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment  
- [ ] Deploy backend API to cloud service (AWS/GCP/Azure)  
- [ ] Deploy frontend static site to CDN (Netlify, Vercel)
